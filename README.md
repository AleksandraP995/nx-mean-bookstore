# My Project
BOOKSTORE APP 

This project is a comprehensive bookstore application developed within an Nx monorepo structure. It includes two main applications:

Client: A dynamic frontend built with Angular.
Server: A robust backend powered by Express.
Additionally, there is a shared library, app-configuration, that facilitates seamless integration between the frontend and backend services.

Key Technologies:
PostgreSQL: Serves as the primary database for storing and managing book data.
Firebase: Utilized for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure user management.
Google Books API: Integrated for retrieving detailed book information directly from Googleâ€™s extensive book database.
This architecture is designed to provide a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance platform for managing a bookstore application.
